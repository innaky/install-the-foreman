# What is Foreman?

Foreman is an open source project that helps system administrators manage servers throughout their lifecycle, from provisioning and 
configuration to orchestration and monitoring. Provisioning support gives you easy control of setting up new servers, and using 
configuration management (Puppet, Ansible, Chef and Salt are supported), you can easily automate repetitive tasks. With Foreman, 
you can quickly deploy applications, and proactively manage change, both on-premise with VMs and bare-metal or in the cloud. 
Foreman scales well to multiple locations (offices, data centres, etc) and multiple organisations, allowing you to grow without 
losing your single source of infrastructure truth.

Foreman, provides comprehensive, interaction facilities including a web frontend, CLI and RESTful API which enables you to build 
higher level business logic on top of a solid foundation. It is deployed in many organizations, managing from 10s to 10,000s of 
servers. Several commercial products are based on Foreman.
